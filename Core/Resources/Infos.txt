TIMx control register 1 (TIMx_CR1)(x = 2 to 5)

CR1 (TIM2 - TIM5)
    Bit 3 OPM: One-pulse mode
        0: Counter is not stopped at update event
        1: Counter stops counting at the next update event (clearing the bit CEN)   

    Bit 0 CEN: Counter enable
        0: Counter disabled
        1: Counter enabled
        Note: 
            External clock, gated mode and encoder mode can work only if the CEN bit has been
            previously set by software. However trigger mode can set the CEN bit automatically by
            hardware.
